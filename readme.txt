Easier sorting for large repeater fields in Advanced Custom Fields plugin

== Description ==

**This plugin requires both the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin *AND* it's paid [Repeater Field add-on](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/).**

The repeater field is a great tool in ACF, but if you have more than few fields, it can be very unwieldy to sort. This plugin collapses each instance of the repeater field to allow for easy sorting.

To help identify each repeater field group, the first field of each repeated field group is shown. See screenshots for an example.
