Easier sorting for large repeater fields in Advanced Custom Fields plugin

== Description ==

**This plugin requires both the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin (version 4.0+ only) *AND* its paid [Repeater Field add-on](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/).**

The repeater field is a great tool in ACF, but if you have more than few fields, it can be very unwieldy to sort. This plugin collapses each instance of the repeater field—when using the "Row" layout—to allow for easy sorting.

To help identify each repeater field group, the first field of each repeated field group is shown. See screenshots for an example.

Contribute to [this plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/mrwweb/ACF-Repeater-Collapser).

This plugin began as a [support forum thread](http://support.advancedcustomfields.com/discussion/comment/16239) on the ACF site.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
1. Upload all files to /wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin on the Plugins page.

== Screenshots ==

1. Even with a few fields per repeater instance, it becomes unwieldy to sort.
2. This plugins creates a new Collapse/Expand button.
3. When collapsed, only the first field for each repeated fieldset is shown.
4. Now it's easy to click-and-drag to change the field order.
